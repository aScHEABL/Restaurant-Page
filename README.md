## Summary <br>

#### What I learned <br>

Very troublesome and tedius having to create DOM elements with vanilla javascript.<br>

My first attempt of using webpack to bundle all the assets. <br>

Spent several hours tried to figure it out why my pushes weren't updated on Github page. Later realized that there's another branch called "gh-page".
